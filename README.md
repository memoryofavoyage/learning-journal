the lesson began with a review of last week. 
then, we learnt how to create a repository and started our learning journals. 
we learnt the anatomy of a script and then we were given tutorial tips.
it can be difficult to remember the anatomy of a script.

i've sorted out what i'm going to do for each tutorial.
i've started on my first tutorial.
i did need a bit of assistance on making the scripts.
