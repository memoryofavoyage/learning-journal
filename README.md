The lesson began with a review of last week. Then, we learnt how to create a repository and started our learning journals. We learnt the anatomy of a script and then we were given tutorial tips. It can be difficult to remember the anatomy of a script.

I've sorted out what i'm going to do for each tutorial. I've started on my first tutorial. I did need a bit of assistance on making the scripts.

My friends are in. We did a stand up meeting. Paul helped me with my tutorial because it wasn't clicking on the square we had to change the z value.

We decided to do a study session in the games lab. I'm a bit stuck on how you make a sprite move across the screen and stop at a certain point.

I started drawing assets before class for the prototype, nothing fancy but I think it's required so that the prototype really seems like a kind of game. In class, I finished my last tutorial and then started on my prototype.
