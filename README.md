My programmer's log

15/10/2024
The lesson began with a review of last week. Then, we learnt how to create a repository and started our learning journals. We learnt the anatomy of a script and then we were given tutorial tips. It can be difficult to remember the anatomy of a script.

I've sorted out what i'm going to do for each tutorial. I've started on my first tutorial. I did need a bit of assistance on making the scripts.

My friends Isaac and Phoebe are sick today. I hope my unity project saved properly on one drive. We just did our stand up meeting. And with Paul's help I finished my first tutorial. Starting on my second one.

My friends are in. We did a stand up meeting. Paul helped me with my tutorial because it wasn't clicking on the square we had to change the z value.

We decided to do a study session in the games lab. I'm a bit stuck on how you make a sprite move across the screen and stop at a certain point.

Isaac's not in. Me and Phoebe kinda got distracted. I kinda need help I don't know how to do this code. He helped me now I just need to explain the scripts.

We did not work on tutorials this lesson.

I started drawing assets before class for the prototype, nothing fancy but I think it's required so that the prototype really seems like a kind of game. In class, I finished my last tutorial and then started on my prototype.

03/12/2024
Today I'm working on the prototype again, we had to fix an issue where I accidentally saved projects inside of projects because it was giving an error due to that. After fixing that, I needed assistance as all the objects were being disabled instead of using the SetActive feature so if you clicked where the objects are it would still interact with it. Also, it would not allow you to exit out of the main page and reopen it because I didn't script it to reopen. We have now made it so that most objects are using SetActive but currently an issue is with the back button which I'm trying to ammend. Currently everything is working as it should be. I'm now thinking of what to implement next, maybe the tutorial where the stick figure slides across the screen, but I might add an actual asset for that.
