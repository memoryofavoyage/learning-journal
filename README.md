# learning-journal
My programmer's log

15/10/2024
The lesson began with a review of last week, which included an explanation of the Pomodoro technique and the fact that we had to write a learning journal. Then, we learnt how to create a repository and started our learning journals. It's easy to make one and commit changes. We learnt the anatomy of a script and then we were given tutorial tips. One of them was the inclusion of visual aids which I plan to add in the forms of screen recordings and screenshots. It can be difficult to remember the anatomy of a script. There are a lot of keywords to learn.

I've sorted out what i'm going to do for each tutorial. It's going to be based on my AGP idea which is an SCP remix of Papers Please, I can use SCP since it is under Creative Commons. I'm pretty sure. If it turns out I'm wrong about that I guess I'll design my own and give them similar abilities. I've started on my first tutorial. My first tutorial is showing people how to script a small square being clicked on to produce a big square, it's supposed to simulate clicking on a document in PP to view it. I did need a bit of assistance on making the scripts.

My friends Isaac and Phoebe are sick today. I guess that means I won't get distracted. I hope my unity project saved properly on one drive. I really should learn how to upload projects to GitHub it'd be a lot easier. We just did our stand up meeting. And with Paul's help I finished my first tutorial. I screen recorded what it does and uploaded it to YouTube so I can put the link on my document. Starting on my second one. My second one will be on making a functioning menu.

My friends are in. We did a stand up meeting. Paul helped me with my tutorial because it wasn't clicking on the square we had to change the z value. I have an object that is called the background that's this big rectangle that covers the whole screen and it's at a low opacity at the front of the hierarchy. So it was covering the square and clicking on the background instead. We found this out by doing a debug log when the background was clicked on. I have to be careful from now on about that.

We decided to do a study session in the games lab. I'm a bit stuck on how you make a sprite move across the screen and stop at a certain point. I think I'll just wait until next lesson so I can get help with that. I find it sort of difficult to work on this at home because eventhough I know I can look up help online it feels like all the search results are not really related to what I'm trying to do, most of it is something way more complex because I guess people don't really ask for help on simple things.

Isaac's not in. Me and Phoebe kind of got distracted. I need to try to focus more in lessons. I kinda need help I don't know how to do this code. He helped me now I just need to explain the scripts. This tutorial is on moving a sprite across the screen and stopping it at a certain point. Originally, I was gonna have text appear when it stops but I wasn't sure how to do that and I think it's good enough for a tutorial maybe without it. It's suppposed to simulate a character coming to the window.

We did not work on tutorials this lesson. Paul explained to us how to upload Unity projects to GitHub but I got a bit confused so I might have to look over it on the VLE. This would really help me because at the moment I'm just zipping a folder and adding it to OneDrive which is I think why I keep doing this thing where I'm saving projects inside of projects, because I'm not really sure how to open a Unity project from a folder like as one transfer. In theory I can just open the scene and add the assets and scripts on after.

I started drawing assets before class for the prototype, nothing fancy but I think it's required so that the prototype really seems like a kind of game. In class, I finished my last tutorial and then started on my prototype. My last tutorial being the sprite moving across the screen one, here was where I finally decided I wasn't going to include text in the tutorial. My prototype is basically how I want my AGP to look, but the assets like I said are rough and not the final product.

Today I'm working on the prototype again, we had to fix that issue where I accidentally saved projects inside of projects because it was giving an error due to that. After fixing that, I needed assistance as all the objects were being disabled instead of using the SetActive feature so if you clicked where the objects are it would still interact with it. Also, it would not allow you to exit out of the main page and reopen it because I didn't script it to reopen. We have now made it so that most objects are using SetActive but currently an issue is with the back button which I'm trying to ammend. Currently everything is working as it should be. I'm now thinking of what to implement next, maybe the tutorial where the stick figure slides across the screen, but I might add an actual asset for that.

My friend left his laptop charger in the games lab and he commutes so I said I'd go up to take it just incase it would get stolen or something, but I also wanted to do some work eventhough the lab is completely empty. I want to work on my prototype but there's something I don't know how to do which is making the plague doctor sprite move back the way it came after the reject button is pressed. I think there is something I can do though, there's another button the game will have that calls the guards and I want to give the game over screen when that is pressed as well. And that's simple to do. But before I do that I've just been adding to this because my friend has like a 3000 word count on his learning journal and I realised mine was only like 400, though now it's more like 1000. I'm not entirely sure if we're marked on how much we write in the learning journal but I'll add to it just incase.
